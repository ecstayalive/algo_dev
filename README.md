# Algorithm developing

This repository is used for testing and developing some algorithms. It is not built from scratch, but rather based upon [Simple Dremer](https://github.com/kc-ml2/SimpleDreamer) and [TD-MPC](https://github.com/nicklashansen/tdmpc).


## RoadMap
- [ ] replacing rssm with state space models
- [ ] find a new method to prevent information collapse
- [ ] implementing dynamic reasoning using predictive coding
- [ ] path search in state space
- [ ] end to end finetuning vae and world model at the same time

## World Model
